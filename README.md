# CS5001 final project
A Guess the K-Pop Song game using Python. The player will be presented with several K-Pop song intros that last only 1 second and need to guess the name of the songs. If they guess correctly, they get 1 point, or they lose 1 point. Once they have 0 points, they lose the game.\
\
The game has three difficulty levels with different settings. The easy level consists of 3 easy songs with 2 starting points, and the playback can be listened to repeatedly; the medium level consists of 5 medium-difficulty songs with 1 starting point. The songs can only be played once more; The difficult level consists of 7 hard-difficulty songs with no starting point. The songs will only be played once.\
